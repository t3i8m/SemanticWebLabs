    "## **Part 2:** Basic `SPARQL`\n",
    "`SPARQL` (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is the standard query language for `RDF` graphs. Think of it as `SQL` for graph data. Instead of selecting from tables and rows, `SPARQL` allows you to describe the shape or pattern of the data you're looking for within the graph. You can read the official W3C specification for `SPARQL 1.1` [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/).\n",

    "A basic query has a few key components.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sparql\n",
    "PREFIX movies: <http://example.org/movies/>\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT ?title ?year\n",
    "WHERE {\n",
    "  ?movie movies:hasTitle ?title ;\n",
    "         movies:releasedInYear ?year .\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "*   **`PREFIX`**: This is a shortcut. It lets us write `movies:hasTitle` instead of `<http://example.org/movies/hasTitle>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`SELECT`**: This specifies which variables you want in your results. A variable in `SPARQL` always starts with a **?**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`WHERE`**: This is the structural part of the query. It contains the triple patterns that `SPARQL` will try to match against the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SPARQL` may not be very intuitive at the beginning. A good way of getting used to it is studying the structure of your target graph(s) beforehand. This will help you reach the variable you are querying for way faster and efficiently.\n",
