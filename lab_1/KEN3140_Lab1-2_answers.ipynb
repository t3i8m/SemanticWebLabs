If someone tries to add a triple that violates these rules, it can be automatically flagged as an error.\n","* **Richer Inferences:** A reasoner can use these rules to infer new information. For instance, if a reasoner sees the triple <code>&lt;lotr:Gandalf&gt; &lt;lotr:hasAge&gt; 9000</code>, and it knows from the schema that the domain of ```hasAge``` is ```lotr:Character```; it can infer that ```lotr:Gandalf``` is an instance of the ```lotr:Character``` class even if that wasn't stated directly.\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","### **Step 4:** Exporting the Schema\n","Now that we have a small but fully-realized schema, we can save it as a ```TURTLE``` (.ttl) file."],"metadata":{"id":"F682Qqbr9OFP"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["g.serialize(destination=\"lotr_schema.ttl\", format=\"ttl\")"],"metadata":{"id":"t7c1R2qbAICL"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["This file can be exported the ontology editor Protégé.
